# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-microscope" %}Research

We develop and use novel approaches for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy capable of combing femtosecond temporal and nanometer spatial resolutions. 
These steps are key to explore ultrafast dynamics in complex nanomaterials on the spatiotemporal scales relevant for applications and fundamental insights.

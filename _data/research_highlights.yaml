  journal: "Nature Nanotechnology (2023)"
  authors: "Seifert et al."
  abstract: "The emerging field of orbitronics exploits the electron orbital momentum L. Compared to spin-polarized electrons, L may allow the transfer of magnetic information with considerably higher density over longer distances in more materials. However, direct experimental observation of L currents, their extended propagation lengths and their conversion into charge currents has remained challenging."

  journal: "Applied Physics Letters (2024)"
  authors: "Alostaz,..., Seifert"
  abstract: "Terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) is a sensitive approach to material characterization. It critically relies on a sufficiently large bandwidth, which is not straightforwardly available in typical THz-TDS systems that are often limited to below 3 THz. Here, we introduce a hybrid THz-source concept based on a spintronic THz emitter (STE)."

  image: "images/400vs800.png"
  journal: "ArXiv (2025)"
  authors: "Rouzegar,..., Seifert"
  abstract: "Ultrafast spintronics strongly relies on the generation, transport, manipulation and detection of terahertz spin currents (TSCs). In F/HM stacks consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F and a heavy-metal layer HM, ultrafast spin currents are typically triggered by femtosecond optical laser pulses. A key open question is whether the initial step, optical excitation and injection of spin currents, can be controlled."

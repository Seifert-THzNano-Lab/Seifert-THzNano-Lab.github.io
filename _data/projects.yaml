  description: We aim at exploring fundamentally new ways to control ultrafast spin and charge currents in ultrathin 2D materials. Currently, our PhD student, [Afnan Alostaz](../members//Afnan Alostaz.html), studies the role of hybrid layers forming between ferromagnets and TMDC and their role in triggering THz spin currets.

  description: Manipulating coupled ferroelectric and magnetic orders on ultrafast time scales holds the promise for efficient future data processing applications. Here, our postdoc, [Reza Rouzegar](../members//Reza Rouzegar.html), studies photoinduced femtosecond charge currents in the multiferroic BiFeO<sub>3</sub>. Our goal is to understand the excitation and couplings of THz ferrons, the ferroelectric equivalent of a magnon.

  description: Understanding the ultrafast dynamics of electrons and spin on their native scales, femtoseconds and nanometers, is extremely relevant to deepen our understanding of fundamental processes underlying the energy-, linear- and angular-momentum relaxation of electrons. On the other hand, such advancements also bear a large potential to enhance nanoscale applications such as transistors or solar cells. In this project, our postdoc, [Atul Pandey](../members//Atul Pandey.html) combines a metallic scanning probe from an atomic force microscope, yielding nanometer spatial resolution, with ultrabroadband THz time-domain spectroscopy, yielding femtosecond time resolution. The studied sample systems include 2D materials, multiferroics and complex antiferromagnets such as altermagnets.

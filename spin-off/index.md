## From Fundamental Research to Market Leader

Our mission is to translate fundamental discoveries in spin dynamics into next-generation **terahertz technology**. A prime example of this successful transfer is the **spintronic terahertz emitter (STE)**—a novel class of broadband, efficient, and low-cost THz sources developed in our laboratories.

To make this technology available to researchers and industries worldwide, **TeraSpinTec GmbH** was founded in 2021 by Prof. Tobias Kampfrath and Dr. Tom S. Seifert. Today, TeraSpinTec supplies high-performance emitters that are redefining the standards of THz spectroscopy.

## Why TeraSpinTec?

The flagship product, the **T-Spin series**, utilizes spintronic principles to overcome the limitations of conventional sources. Key advantages include:
* **Gapless Bandwidth:** Covers the entire 0.1 to 30 THz range.
* **Versatility:** Works with any laser pump wavelength from mid-IR to X-rays.
* **Full Control:** Polarization is easily tunable via external magnetic fields.
